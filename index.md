### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, parts 1-3 was a favorite because it was a memorable experience becuase this was the first time i learned how to "actually code." I've learned the basics of HTML and CSS, but coding this way was an entirely new language. I like how I was able to learn how to edit a poorly structured code and form of knowledge with how to clone a git repository from GitHub and make changes to it. I had no idea how to execute it before or how to fix my errors.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, was another favorite of mine because I leanred to utilize nested loops in my coding.Â It was amazing how a game could be created from just a few lines of code. I discovered how to create a game where the player makes decisions that loop till the player wins. I even played around with it on my own time after I finished this lab.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, was my 3rd favorite because I was always grew up playing black jack online becuase I couldn't afford expensive games growing up. It is so cool how I got to create the game on my own by writing functions till the numbers calculate the correct number. It was challenging to write but it was very memorable to learn.
